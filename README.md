# ideal-job-searching

I will be keep recording the way I search for an ideal job here in the way of data scientist way in this repo.

# What
The very first question is: what is my ideal job.
- Company should be big: the reason why I put this at the top is that I want to meet talented people as much as I can. 
- Data scientist: I really love working with data. By saying this, I want to use python to analyze data for business which will have the oppurtunity to talk to product manager to work out a solution for some kind of product. ETL could be required but not the main target.

# How
- 2 projects should be done: reddit sentiment and one complete kaggle competition
- analyze the requirement for this position: work out a jupyter notebook for provisioning common requirement for this position
- get a list of back up company
- keep working on leetcode competition 
- keep updating resumé
